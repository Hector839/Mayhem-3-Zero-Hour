<t id="5">[justify][author]\033MTerracorp[/author]We just received your report about the global Terraformer progress. According to you they are almost at the gates to Terra itself!\nLook, its out of the question that your assessment is valuable to us. But we wonder why your report contradicts our own observations so severely. Please remember that we have to consider the state of the entire galaxy and will only react if biological LIFE itself is at stake. According to our other intel sources this doesn't seem to be the case yet.\n\nMaybe you have your own severe problems with the OCV. Be assured that we send our honest condolences. But we simply cannot take away the freedom to wage war in this outer bordre galaxy. At least not yet.\n\n[yellow]The global progress of the Terraformers is simply too low right now. Terracorp will refuse to declare a coalition against them. No sitrep will sway them at this point, even if you'd convince all factions to warn them like you just did. Try again when the Xenon own much more sectors or when the OCV fleet has grown much stronger.[/yellow][/justify]</t>

Terracorp covers three quarters of all mercenary costs!\n\nThe United Commonwealth needs to fight the Xenon back to their Maelstrom sector. If you win this war the machines will be crippled for a long time. As you read this, all factions have already started to work hard to achieve this goal. What will you do? This is the time when legends and heroes are born!</t>
<t id="7">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]Tip:  if a Trader does not belong to one of the main factions you can scan his cargo and kill him without damaging your reputation!

<t id="14">[author]Flagship of the Nomad Fleet[/author]To everyone fleeing from the Xenon Empire,\n\nWe are experienced survivors of countless other galaxies that the OCV destroyed before yours.\n\nNever give up buddy!

We give you a military ship, you go earn some cash and then pay us back...\n\n[yellow]Tutorial:[/yellow]\nThe [yellow]Nomads[/yellow] are a new wandering alien faction. They follow the OCV into other galaxies to exploit the refugee chaos that the machines leave behind. The Nomad elite lives in their Flagship, a mobile shipyard. Desperate refugees who arrive at the Nomad Flagship get armed and sent back into the galaxy to become mercs for hire. But they have lots of debt and their families are being held hostage.\n\nNomad mercs work for [yellow]half the price[/yellow]. But they are not very experienced or disciplined. Eventually they run away \(stealing the upfront hiring fee\), or even try their luck as a new pirate gang! Only an [yellow]infamous[/yellow] leader could keep them in line long enough to build a real merc army.</t>
<t id="15">[yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]You have just received %s new people in your %s! They are [yellow]Refugees[/yellow] from a sector which got attacked by the Terraformers.\n\nRefugees will only come to your Outposts if you are honorable \(no infamy\). This allows to exceed the usual population limit by up to the double amount to get more Taxes, Waste generation and production speed. But keep in mind that these additional people cannot regrow naturally if you start building ships, which requires pilots, or if a desease or famine reduces your total population.\n\nHarming innocent refugees would quickly turn you into a very evil person. And you wouldn't want that, do you?</t>
<t id="16">[author]Nomad Merc Broadcast[/author]Fellow Nomads! The time has come for us to take revenge on the Xenon! Wipe the machines from the face of this galaxy!\n\nAvenge your families!\n\nHonor your fallen brothers and sisters!\n\nATTACK!\n\n[yellow]Tutorial:[/yellow]\nMost Nomad mercs in the galaxy will follow this call to arms. The fools are currently betraying their current contracts to attack the Xenon Empire.</t>
<t id="17">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]Tip to [yellow]save money[/yellow]:\nThe default mindset of your Outposts is to keep every ware stored inside unless you tell them to sell it. This often causes certain problems for new players.\nFor example your [yellow]random Loot does not get sold[/yellow], and your Traders will often buy something but they miss their planned selling opportunity and just [yellow]dump all their junk into your Outpost and then go buy even more[/yellow].\n\nIf you don't tell your Outposts to sell you will create many [yellow]useless stockpiles[/yellow] of random goods everywhere. [yellow]This burns your money[/yellow].\n\nPreviously this could only be fixed by deep diving into the Outpost trade settings for an hour or so.\n\nBut the Zero Hour Mod has a very neat little Tool called [yellow]QuickTrade[/yellow] which fixes all these issues in a couple of clicks.\n\nQuickTrade basically changes the general mindset of your Outposts from hoarding everything \(burning your cash\) towards selling everything that you do not need. And Traders will not buy what their Outpost already wants to sell.\n\nYou can expand and collapse the list of QuickTrade modules in the Logistics>Trade section of your Outpost Manager. You always need to tell QuickTrade what kind of Outpost you want by combining different modules. For example a station crafting Outpost that doesn't buy anything should get modules 1, 2 and 5.</t>
