They follow the OCV into other galaxies to exploit the refugee chaos that the machines leave behind. The Nomad elite lives in their Flagship, a mobile shipyard.

But they have lots of debt and their families are being held hostage.\n\nNomad mercs work for [yellow]half the price[/yellow]. But they are not very experienced or disciplined.

This allows to exceed the usual population limit by up to the double amount to get more Taxes, Waste generation and production speed. But keep in mind that these additional people cannot regrow naturally if you start building ships, which requires pilots, or if a desease or famine reduces your total population.\n\nHarming innocent refugees would quickly turn you into a very evil person. And you wouldn't want that, do you?</t>
<t id="16">[author]Nomad John Doe[/author]Fellow Nomads! The time has come for us to take revenge on the Xenon who destroyed our home stations! Wipe the machines from the face of this galaxy!\n\nAvenge your families!\n\nHonor your fallen brothers and sisters!\n\nFollow me! WE ATTACK!\n\n[yellow]Tutorial:[/yellow]\nThe Nomad Mercs in the galaxy have gone crazy. The fools are currently betraying all contracts and just rush into the Xenon Empire in an unorganized manner. Their blind rage will cause them to attack everyone, but they will probably not return anyway.</t>
<t id="17">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author][white]What is QuickTrade?\n\nThe default mindset of your Outpost is to keep every ware stored inside unless you specifically allow to sell something.\nThe problem with this is that random Loot piles up everywhere. Same for the color minerals that your Miners frequently haul inside. And even worse, your Traders will use the Outpost storage for their inventory management. They often dump something inside the Outpost just to free up their cargohold. On default this junk just never gets sold and your Traders will slowly burn money away.\n\n\nThe solution is QuickTrade. Its just a set of buttons which act as shortcuts to quickly set up trade settings on an Outpost so that the station fills a specific role in your empire.\n\nFor example you might want to keep almost everything in Outpost A to build your ships there. But Outpost B should make money and only keep the food that it needs, together with resources that it supplies to nearby factories.\n\nNow you would combine the various Quicktrade modules on both Outposts. Be aware that they can partially override each other. Its always best to think which wares you want to keep, rather than what you want to sell. Because you will certainly forget something and then never think of that hidden stockpile of red minerals which could be sold for 2 million credits.\n\nApply QuickTrade modules from top to bottom. I recommend to start with the first one - SELL ALL - literally all the time, on pretty much every Outpost. And then tell them what resources they need to keep. Doing it this way will make you very rich quickly, especially if you also open trade for other factions.\n\n\nAll of the RESERVE modules tell the Outpost to keep something stored and only start selling if the Outpost accumulates an unnecessarily large stockpile.\n\nAll SUPPLY modules work similar to the Reserve modules, but Supply also sets up small buy orders to generate an influx of resources from outside your empire.[/white]</t>
<t id="18">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]Welcome to the [yellow]Chaotic galaxy start[/yellow]!  \(you selected it in the galaxy generator\)\n\nThis plays a bit different.\nThe OCV begins with powerful invader fleets and over the next couple hours the Xenon receive extra defense fleets for their already large territory. They tend to put them close to the OCV Maelstrom in %s.\n\n\nAll empires will soon band together.\n\nDuring this massive war Terracorp says that its illegal to fight each other.\n\nRight from the beginning all empty unknown sectors can be claimed by anyone. You might need to get creative to start your empire. Waiting in SETA mode is also viable. New empty areas often appear during the crisis.</t>

If you own any of these you give that faction much more reason to go to war with you.\n- most of the time it will be your neighbors who declare war\n- lots of factors dictate their overall desire to declare war.

<t id="24">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WIt seems like you are pretty broke. You will need more money to buy important resources.\n\nTips:\n\n> be careful with automatic Traders if Pirates are still a problem in your sectors. Group your freighters up by sending one of them to a trading station and have all the others follow him. Trade a lot of different wares at once and guard your convoy with all available military ships.\nTry to connect your Outpost and the trading station with jump beacons.\n\n> add a ware that you can sell to the Outpost's trade list with import and export thresholds at 0. The best examples are foods like Vegetables or Fish that your Outposts will constantly produce if they have the food that the population demands. Its always better to fulfill these demands because then the population generates twice as much of another food. Sell that and you already get some good passive income. For the time being you should also allow foreign Traders to visit your Outposts. Don't worry! They will respect your trade rules and cannot steal important resources that you did not allow to sell.\n\n> build an Advanced Satellite factory and give it some money. Then allow Traders to come and trade. This will always be profitable even if you have to buy all the energy cells for this station.\n\n> the bounty board in your player console might be very useful right now.\n\n> visit a faction sector which has a lot of factories and start doing some Cargo Taxi jobs by registering your freighter in the Personal Console. This earns some quick bucks to stay afloat with lots of additional reputation to balance out your future territorial expansion.\n\n> certain Perks generate some ware for free or save resources that you won't need to buy as much. Like Cheaper Stations, No food consumption, Solar Panels, Spaceweed Production, or Tax.\n\n> go scan some NPC miners with your Data Scanner, buy 16 mobile drilling systems at a trading station and start building 4 miners for your sector. They generate decent profit over time, but only if you actually sell their output. So add color crystals and minerals on the trade list! The best way to do this is via QuickTrade in Logistics>Traders.[/justify]</t>
<t id="25">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou already own quite a lot of sectors, but your military power is still weak. Of course it can be useful to reserve nearby empty sectors for later use, but be careful! You are playing on a difficulty level where the AI watches your overall progress and can eventually declare war. You should have a plan how to get money, resources and military power besides only having a large territory. Only military power will deter other factions from declaring war you. If you keep expanding into more sectors at all costs you will might attract lots of powerful invasions and loose the game.[/justify]</t>
<t id="26">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You need to choose a starting sector for your empire.\n\nAll your sectors project a [yellow]Zone of Control[/yellow] \(ZoC\) over adjacent empty Unknown sectors.\n\nOther factions are much less likely to claim sectors inside your ZoC. So plan your early strategy around this concept. Select sectors so that you protect many additional empty sectors and reserve them for your future expansion.\n\nThere are no guarantees that nobody is gonna claim these sectors, but you greatly increase the odds that they remain available for a long time.\n\nFactions can still violate your ZoC, especially if you have infamy. On hard game difficulty ZoC is generally less reliable and the other factions can even send Explorers past your sectors to claim empty sectors behind them.[/justify]</t>
<t id="27">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author][white]Seems like you got your hands on a capship. It might be wise to recycle this [/white]%s[white] to quickly unlock its blueprint with a massive research bonus. This can be done in any Outpost. Unlocking the rest of the blueprint in your research station will be very quick. You even get half of the resources back, so its only a small loss. With General commands > Strip you can remove all weapons and shields beforehand and reuse them once you have built another [/white]%s.[/justify]</t>
<t id="28">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou have aquired some marines.\n\nNow you only need Boarding pods. They get sold on pirate stations or can be crafted with the Outpost Missle Manufacture perk.\nYou can recruit marine volunteers for free on any Outpost, but they start with very low skills.\nYou always need some veteran marines too. Those are only sold at pirate stations.\n\nTo board a ship you can shoot boarding pods like missles or use the boarding command in the Hacking section of the ship command console.\n\nYour Marines need a certain combined fighting skill to pass and survive all battles through various ship decks. Some mechanical skill is required to break the ship hull, and Hacking skill to unlock the ship core. Engineering skill only lowers collateral damage to the ship hull.\n\nYour losses depend on combined fighting skill and on how many marines you send. More marines means more of them will get killed. Don't send elite teams of highly skilled marines against low value targets like an M6.\n\nAll you need is one decent hacker who reaches the final ship deck and one good mechanic for each boarding pod fired. Each pod can hold 5 marines.\nAll ships can carry 15 marines. TPs can store 60 marines.\nA Transporter Device allows for remote marine exchange between ships.\nOnly TM, M6, M7, M8, M1 and M2 can be boarded.\nYou can fire additional boarding pods during the operation. For example to send marines with hacking skill later during the fight and increase their chances of survival.[/justify]</t>
<t id="29">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou just suffered random marine losses on the final bridge of the ship. For each boarding operation there is a kamikaze ambush or boobytrap explosion at the very end, which can kill additional marines. The difference to the deck fights before is that fighting skill does not help to prevent marine losses. It only matters how many marines have reached the ship bridge. The more crowded it is, the more losses you will suffer. These losses are completely random and can easily kill high skill marines.\n\nThis means that there is an incentive for you to only send just enough skilled marines so that you can pass all skill checks and win the ship, but without loosing many high level marines in the final casualty round. To reduce your losses you can try to board with few high skill marines or with a mixed team that also has some rookie volunteers. Those can be hired en masse on your Outposts. They add a little bit of fighting skill to your side, but its no real loss if they die. What matters most are your veteran fighters and mechanical or hacking specialists.[/justify]</t>
<t id="30">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WThe best bounties are usually put on Pirate Gangs. If you kill the leader their morale breaks and they scatter in different directions.\nHunting gang leaders is a good way to make lots of money during the earlier stages of your playthrough. Especially since you don't need to defeat the entire pirate gang and only kill their leader.\n\nOther frequent bounties are Pirate Raid Carrier TM. They transport pirate fighters over larger distances and drop them near their victims. The bounty increases with each hot drop. But the TM is very fast, decently shielded and always wants to escape you so it might be hard to catch.\nIf a TM grows a too large bounty it can return to a pirate base for a hull respray. Its like removing wanted level in GTA.[/justify]</t>
<t id="31">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYour Jump Beacons will attract small Xenon scouts which can turn them against you and create teleport routes for Xenon fleets.\n\nIts highly recommended that you guard each beacon with at least 1 M3 fighter. Its enough to park a ship nearby in space without giving any orders. It automatically attacks approaching Xenon scouts and you will get notified at the bottom of your screen. This also works if you tell that ship to Escort:Protect the beacon itself.\n\nOwning more jump beacons will increase the frequency at which Xenon scouts try to infect one of them. But its usually well worth it to claim jump beacons if they help your travel network in any way. You just need to protect them.[/justify]</t>
<t id="32">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou already played for a while, but i don't see any larger ships like frigates in your fleet.\nDid you know that pirate bases often contain an M7? The pirate boss will try to escape and if you scare him fast enough by draining his shields he will bail out and you can claim the ship. If you take too long with the shields he will become too confident and not bail out.\n\nAnoher fast way to unlock larger ships is to steal one with marines or the Oxygen virus hack and then reverse engineering it in an Outpost recycling bay for a massive research boost.[/justify]</t>
<t id="33">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author][white]Your sector[/white] %s [white]has a lot of pirates flying around in it. They are probably coming from some Pirate Base in the general area.\nThe Pirates are less aggressive than the Xenon and often wait for easy targets like TS and TP. Those freighters can usually flee to a station before their shields get breached, but heavy pirate activity prevents them from doing their work and makes long trips very risky.\n\nTips:\n\n> to thin out the pirate horde you can set up a fast picket fleet of about 3 fighters. Anyone should be able to afford such a small security investment. Use the following fleet settings and they should survive well:\nMonitor all sectors of this faction: PLAYER\nRetreat from enemy ship class: M6\nScanning range: 0 KM\nFollowers engage commanders target: YES\nIgnore: BIG SHIPS and FREIGHTERS\n\n> consider not using your current freighters as Agents, Miners or Traders yet. Instead form them up into a large convoy for better safety and buy or sell manually with this entire group for now. Keep them together and also combine all your military ships to protect them.\n\n> use TM or M6 as Looters instead of TS or TP Pirates mostly like to attack freighters\n\n> gain infamy. All pirates will attack you much less if you are a criminal like them.\n\n> open your stations to NPC Traders so you don't need to send freighters of your own. Stations with a resource input should be given some money to buy it. Keeping stations idle for long is always a waste because they would all produce something more valuable if you just manage to keep them running. This includes your Outposts which need food but can produce twice as much other food plus additional resources for free.\n\n> unlock the Pirate Contract perk if you are completely surrounded or desperate\n\n> with a fleet of about 3 M6 and a dozen M3 fighters you can start destroying pirate bases near your empire. This will help greatly in the long run.[/white][/justify]</t>

Factions generally desire to control their dejure sectors and don't like it when they are controlled by someone else. Battlegroups will often focus to conquer these sectors first.\n\nYou are playing on a difficulty level which allows the AI to declare war on you. Just you controlling %s already gives the %s a major incentive to go to war with you.

So their Battlegroups will often focus on these sectors first.\n\nYou are playing on a difficulty level which allows the AI to declare war on you. Just you controlling %s already gives the Terrans a major incentive to go to war with you. If you want to avoid conflict with them in the future it might be best to hand it over to them.

<t id="36">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You have just built your first factory, a %s.\n\nFrom time to time it needs to get visited by a freighter so it can keep running. Resources must be delivered and finished products hauled away. Mayhem 3 doesn't have self sufficient complexes, so cargo transport is always a thing but with many different solutions!\n\nIn general there are three different ways how you can organize all the shipping logistics in your empire. There is no universal best method as all of them have their uses.\n\n1\) Manual Shipping\nDon't underestimate how long a single visit by a freighter can keep a factory supplied and running.\nDuring the earlygame many players struggle with pirates attacking their freighters. The easiest fix is to send a freighter with a manual command and deliver resources only when its quite safe. For example after a dangerous pirate group has just left your sector. Don't be ashamed if you have to group up all your ships and fly from station to station if need be.\n\n2\) Automatic Closed Economy\nEventually you want a network of Agent Workers to distribute most resources between your stations. Their homebase can be a factory but an Outpost is recommended.\nIn Logistics>Agents you can tell each Outpost which wares its Agents should gather or redustribute from there.\nIts best to apply the 'Complete' job template which covers all relevant factories and make further changes if needed. The Outpost Worker range determines how far your Agents are allowed to go on the galaxy map.\n\n3\) Free Trade\nEach station will either allow foreign traders to come and trade, or it forbids them from doing so. On player stations its blocked by default but you can always turn it on.\nEspecially during the earlygame it can be very useful to allow trade on certain stations. Sometimes your freighters are unable to reach your stations because of pirates. Then you can just pay other factions do the hauling for you. The refinement process in your factories earns enough profit for this. A major advantage is that you can keep all your freighters docked safely but your factories can already start producing. This allows for quicker overall economic growth. Later you can switch to a closed economy and forbid trade again.\n\nMost factories will need about 100k credits starting capital to buy their first resources. Its almost impossible to loose money here as long as you keep selling what you produce and don't stockpile it too much.\n\nYour Outpost will only trade wares that you have added to a special trade list in Logistics>Traders\n\nThe downside of allowing trade is that you often want to produce something primarily for your own consumption, but you cannot prevent that a Trader sometimes takes resources to another faction. That's why you should forbid trade for a few strategically important ship part factories like Hull Plating or Crystal fabs.[/justify]</t>
<t id="37">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]Claiming %s consumed most of your %s reputation. Its no immediate problem, but to be able to expand more towards their borders and remain friendly you should earn more goodwill.\n\nA fast and efficient but slightly grindy remedy are missions and cargo hauler or taxi jobs.\n\nA passive way to earn reputation is defending %s sectors with some automated fleets like these:\n\n\nHunt Pirate Fighters:\n3 M3 with fleet settings > Monitor faction: %s, Retreat from class: M6, Scanning range: 0 KM, Followers attack commanders target: YES, Ignore: Big ships and freighters\n\nHunt Pirate Corvettes:\n1 M7 + 3 M6 with fleet settings > Monitor faction: %s, Retreat from class: Large capships, Scanning range: 10 KM, Followers attack commanders target: NO, Target priority for huge ships: big ships, Ignore: Fighters and freighters
[/justify]</t>
<t id="38">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You don't have many %s left.\n\nThis is one of the 4 important components that are required to produce ships with their shields and lasers.\n\nYou should always try to refill Computers, Hull Plating, Quantum Tubes and the basic non colored Crystals as soon as you start to run out. It is often required to buy more of these before you have built all the required factories.\n\n%s might be difficult to find on the open market. Terracorp forbids trading stations to deal with high-end ship parts.\n\nBut you can always buy them directly from %s factories and sometimes also certain faction Outposts with very large stockpiles.\n\nIf you give a freighter the command Trade-Run:Buy %s he might find such a high quantity seller.\nTrade Run is an automated trade command. Your guy gives the station a call so that they already reserve the wares for him. Trader Workers also do this.\n\nIts quite common that automatic trade cannot find a seller. This just means that everyone is only offering small amounts which cannot be bought with automated trade.\nBut all factories always have at least a little bit of product ready. They are willing to sell it to you if you tell a freighter to dock and then do the trade manually. To find these stations you should use the Trade Product Search command. Paying a higher price is still a good deal if it helps to get this ware at all.\n\nWhen everything fails you can craft %s with the mobile factory in your TL. But this consumes way more resources than normal factories.[/justify]</t>
<t id="39">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]The %s want to create a coalition against the %s. You can see this in the relations tab of your Ministry of War \(Personal Console\).\n\nA coalition is an alliance of multiple smaller factions with the shared goal of massively reducing the territory size of a larger empire. This forges a close bond between the partners.\n\nYou can become part of this too. Either as a small member or a large target. From the diplomacy screen you can declare that you desire a coalition against another empire.\nA coalition gets created when two factions want a coalition against the same enemy. Factions may also join into existing coalitions.\n\nIf you were to declare your desire for a coalition against the %s right now, then this would create a coalition with the %s.\n\nA coalition has certain benefits:\n\n> your partners will never declare war on you \(this is only relevant for the hardest game difficulty\)\n> you can activate free diplomatic favor actions\n> your partners won't mind if you conquer sectors at their borders\n\nYou can always revoke your coalition desire unless you are already a coalition member. At this point you cannot leave anymore and have to fight like you promised before. Coalitions only get dissolved when the targeted enemy faction eventually owns less sectors than the largest coalition member.[/justify]</t>
