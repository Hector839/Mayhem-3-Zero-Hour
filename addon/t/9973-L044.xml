<t id="1">[justify][author]\033MTerracorp[/author]Dear %s,\n\nas a landed ruler of the Commonwealth you are obligated to report any Terraformer activities to us. The machines expand from a [red]Maelstrom[/red] in the sector %s. We want your assessment whether this is an existential threat to all biological life in this outer border galaxy.\n\n[yellow]Xenon Crisis Mechanic:[/yellow]\nWhen the galaxy is in danger Terracorp can force everyone to stop their wars and unite in a big coalition. But Terracorp doesn't pay much attention. They have thousands of other galaxies to tend to, so your Xenon reports have some influence. Their undertone can be changed in the [white]personal journal[/white].\n\nTerracorp is especially inclined to listen to what an absolute majority of combined military power in the Commonwealth has to say. Weak factions with Xenon problems often work towards a global coalition. Strong factions want to prevent it. There is a new diplomatic [white]favor action[/white] which allows you to write the Xenon reports for other empires.[/justify]</t>

<t id="5">[justify][author]\033MTerracorp[/author]We just received your report about the global Terraformer progress. According to you they are almost at the gates to Terra itself!\nLook, its out of the question that your assessment is valuable to us. But we wonder why your report contradicts our own observations so severely. Please remember that we have to consider the state of the entire galaxy and will only react if biological LIFE itself is at stake. According to our other intel sources this doesn't seem to be the case yet.\n\nMaybe you have your own severe problems with the OCV. Be assured that we send our honest condolences. But we simply cannot take away the freedom to wage war in this outer bordre galaxy. At least not yet.\n\n[yellow]The global progress of the Terraformers is simply too low right now. Terracorp will refuse to declare a coalition against them. No sitrep will sway them at this point, even if you'd convince all factions to warn them like you just did. Try again when the Xenon own much more sectors or when the OCV fleet has grown much stronger.[/yellow][/justify]</t>
 <t id="6">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]A global Xenon Crisis has been declared!\n\n> all main factions are now allied\n> you have truces with all of them. Your permanent wars are temporarily suppressed.\n> every Commonwealth sector is protected by Terracorp\n> additional cash reward for OCV and Xenon kills\n\n\nThis Crisis can only end once the OCV fleet is much weaker and the Xenon territory much smaller. All factions work hard towards this goal.</t>
