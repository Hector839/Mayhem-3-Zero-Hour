<t id="1">[justify][author]\033BGalactic Security Council[/author]Dear %s,\n\nyou have been granted a permanent seat in the [blue]Galactic Security Council[/blue]. This  committee is a reaction to the growing Terraformer menace. All member states respect each other as sovereign nations. But this machine onslaught could eventually threaten the very existence of life itself.\nShould the issue ever get out of hand we need to stop all our petty conflicts and stand united. We cannot afford to throw our fleets against the machines while selfish nations would use the opportunity to stab us in the back! Our plan is to maintain a secure channel to the [magenta]Terra Corporation[/magenta]. Only they have the authority to act as a mediator and enforce peace in the galaxy.\n\nAs an active council member you can send your petition to Terracorp. If a majority of council members would support the creation of such an alliance Terracorp should listen to us.\nTogether we can fight the machines back to where they came from! The [red]OCV Maelstrom[/red] in the sector %s!\n\n[yellow]You can change your vote in your personal journal. Factions with more military power have greater influence over Terracorp. Powerful factions which don't have serious problems with the OCV will generally vote against an alliance. There is a diplomatic favor action which forces a faction to follow your vote.[/yellow][/justify]</t>
