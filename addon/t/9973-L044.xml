<t id="5">[justify][author]\033MTerracorp[/author]We just received your report about the global Terraformer progress. According to you they are almost at the gates to Terra itself!\nLook, its out of the question that your assessment is valuable to us. But we wonder why your report contradicts our own observations so severely. Please remember that we have to consider the state of the entire galaxy and will only react if biological LIFE itself is at stake. According to our other intel sources this doesn't seem to be the case yet.\n\nMaybe you have your own severe problems with the OCV. Be assured that we send our honest condolences. But we simply cannot take away the freedom to wage war in this outer bordre galaxy. At least not yet.\n\n[yellow]The global progress of the Terraformers is simply too low right now. Terracorp will refuse to declare a coalition against them. No sitrep will sway them at this point, even if you'd convince all factions to warn them like you just did. Try again when the Xenon own much more sectors or when the OCV fleet has grown much stronger.[/yellow][/justify]</t>

Terracorp covers three quarters of all mercenary costs!\n\nThe United Commonwealth needs to fight the Xenon back to their Maelstrom sector. If you win this war the machines will be crippled for a long time. As you read this, all factions have already started to work hard to achieve this goal. What will you do? This is the time when legends and heroes are born!</t>

We will help and provide ships to you.\n\n[yellow]Tutorial:[/yellow]\nThe Nomads are a new refugee faction. When the Xenon or OCV destroy a station, a few survivors sometimes manage to escape in a TP. They'll drop off various passengers with their families and sell any resources from their lost home. Then they head off to the Nomad Flagship. It relies on a constant stream of these refugees to be able to build special mobile factory ships and mercenary fleets.</t>

This allows you to exceed your usual population limit by up to the double amount for more Taxes, Waste generation and production speed. But keep in mind that these additional people will cannot regrow naturally if you start building ships which require pilots or if a desease or famine reduces your population.\n\nHarming refugees would quickly turn you into a very famous and very evil person. And you don't want that, don't you?</t>
