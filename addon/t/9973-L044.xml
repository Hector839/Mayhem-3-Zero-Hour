But keep in mind that these additional people cannot regrow naturally if you start building ships, which requires pilots, or if a desease or famine reduces your total population.\n\nDestroying Humanitarian Aid Refugee Transports adds lots of infamy.</t>

<t id="17">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author][white]What is QuickTrade?\n\nThe default mindset of your Outpost is to keep every ware stored inside until you specifically allow to sell something.\nThe problem is that random stuff piles up in all Outposts that have Looters. Same for the color minerals that your Miners frequently drop inside. And even worse, your Traders will use their Outpost's storage for inventory management. They often dump something inside only to free up their cargohold. On default this junk will never get sold and your Traders just burn money away.\n\n\nThe solution is QuickTrade. A set of buttons which are shortcuts to apply the most commonly used trade settings.\n\nFor example you might want to store almost everything in Outpost A and build all your ships there. But Outpost B should earn money and only keep the food item that it needs, together with all the resources that its Agents supply to nearby factories.\n\nTo get a setup like this you can combine the various Quicktrade modules on both Outposts. Be aware that some of them obviously override each other's settings. Its always best to define which wares you want to keep, rather than what you want to sell. Because you will certainly never notice a hidden stockpile of red minerals which could be sold for 2 million credits.\n\nI recommend to start with the first QuickTrade module - SELL ALL - on pretty much every Outpost. And then just tell it what resources it needs to keep there.\n\n\nAll of the RESERVE modules tell that Outpost to keep enough of something stored inside, whether that be factory resources or ship and station crafting parts and all the associated weapon types and color crystals that you usually want to have ready.\n\nAll SUPPLY modules work similar to the Reserve modules, but they also set up small buy orders to generate an influx of resources from outside your empire. When using any Supply modules i recommend to allow NPC Traders visiting your Outpost to get those wares faster.[/white]</t>
<t id="18">[author][yellow]Tutorial[/yellow][/author]Welcome to the [yellow]Chaotic galaxy start[/yellow]!  \(you selected it in the galaxy generator\)\n\nThis plays a bit different.\nThe OCV begins with powerful invader fleets and over the next couple hours the Xenon receive extra defense fleets for their already large territory. They tend to put them close to the OCV Maelstrom in %s.\n\n\nAll empires will soon band together.\n\nDuring this massive war Terracorp makes it illegal to fight each other.\n\nRight from the beginning all empty unknown sectors can be claimed by anyone. You might need to get creative to start your empire. Waiting in SETA mode is also viable. New empty areas often appear during the crisis.\n\nWhen playing on the largest galaxy size can take the factions multiple days to win the global Xenon war and you cannot fight anyone else until its over.</t>

Factions want to take them from you. Terrans want their Terran memory sectors. If you own any of these you are giving that faction much more reason to go to war with you.\n- mostly just your neighbors with a sector border can declare war\n- lots of strategic factors influence a faction's desire to declare war on you. Their Coalitions, Total Wars, Xenon troubles, faction strength. Use common sense! The most dangerous factions are strong neighbors without major enemies who don't have anything better to do than betray you.\n- you started as %s. They naturally have a much lower desire to declare war on you, but might still do it. Especially if you own their dejure sectors!\n- certain races are naturally more aggressive than others \(good vs. evil Ethos\). Go for Borons if you want a reliable ally.</t>

<t id="24">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WIt seems like you are pretty broke. You need more money in order to buy important resources.\n\nTips:\n\n> be careful with automatic Traders as long as Pirates are still a problem in your sectors. Group up your freighters by sending one of them to a trading station and have all the others follow him. Trading stations offer a lot of different wares at once. You can guard this convoy with all available military ships.\nTry to connect your Outpost with the trading station using jump beacons.\n\n> add a ware that you want to sell to the Outpost's trade list with an import and export threshold of 0. The best examples are food items like Vegetables or Fish that your Outposts will constantly produce if they have the other type of food that their own population demands. Its always better to fulfill these demands because then the Outpost population generates twice as much other food. If you sell that you already get one of the best passive incomes that you can have. For the time being you should also allow foreign Traders to trade with your Outpost. Don't worry! They will respect your trade rules and cannot steal important resources that you do not want to get sold.\n\n> build an Advanced Satellite factory and give it some money. Then allow foreign Traders to come and trade. This will always be very profitable even if you have to buy all the energy cells for this station.\n\n> the bounty board in your player console is very useful right now.\n\n> visit a faction sector which has a lot of factories and start doing some easy Cargo or Taxi jobs by registering your playership freighter in the Personal Console. This earns quick bucks to stay afloat and lots of reputation to make them tolerate your future territory expansion efforts.\n\n> certain Perks generate some ware for free or save certain resources that you won't need to buy as much. Like Cheaper Stations, No food consumption, Solar Panels, Spaceweed Production, or Tax.\n\n> go scan some NPC miners with your Data Scanner, buy 16 mobile drilling systems at a trading station and start building 4 miners for every Outpost. They generate very good profit over time, but only if you actually sell their output. So always add color crystals and minerals to the Outpost trade list! The best way to do that is via QuickTrade in Logistics>Traders. The module SELL ALL turns those color minerals into money and SHIPYARD RESERVE stores the color crystals so you can keep upgrading your ships there.[/justify]</t>
<t id="25">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou already own quite a lot of sectors, but your military power is still weak. Of course it can be useful to claim empty sectors for later use, but be careful! You are playing on a difficulty level where the AI watches your overall progress and very aggressive sector grabbing before your empire is ready can get you into trouble. Besides getting a larger territory you should also have a plan how you want to make money, get more resources and fleet power. You will need military power to deter other factions. If you appear as an easy target they will constantly declare war and slowly take all your sectors away.[/justify]</t>
<t id="26">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You need to choose a starting location for your empire.\n\nAll your sectors project a [yellow]Zone of Control[/yellow] \(ZoC\) that protects adjacent empty Unknown sectors.\n\nOther factions are much less likely to claim sectors inside your ZoC. You should plan your initial strategy around this concept. Select your sectors so that you can cover many additional empty sectors and reserve them for your future expansion.\n\nZoC will not work all the time. Factions can just decide to violate your sphere of influence anyway. Especially if you have any infamy. But you still sort of show your presence and this greatly increases the odds that these sectors will remain available for some time.\n\nOn the hardest game difficulty ZoC is generally less reliable and the other factions sometimes send Explorers even past your sectors to claim empty sectors behind them.[/justify]</t>
<t id="27">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author][white]Seems like you got your hands on a capship. It might be wise to recycle this [/white]%s[white] to get a massive research bonus. This can be done in any Outpost. Unlocking the rest of the blueprint in your research station will be very quick. Recycling even gives you half of the resources back, so its only a minor loss. With General commands > Strip you can remove all weapons and shields beforehand and reuse them once you have built another [/white]%s.[/justify]</t>
<t id="28">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou have aquired marines.\n\nNow you only need Boarding pods. They get sold on pirate stations or get crafted with the Outpost Missle Manufacture perk.\nYou can recruit marine volunteers for free in the Hangar section of the Outpost manager screen, but they start with very low skills.\nYou always need to aquire a few veteran marines to pass certain skill checks. Those are sold at pirate stations.\n\nTo board a ship you can shoot boarding pods just like missles or use the boarding command in the Hacking section your ship's command console.\n\nYour Marines combine their fighting skill to pass and survive battles through the various ship decks. You often need some initial mechanical skill to break the ship hull, and some Hacking skill to unlock the ship core at the end. Engineering skill is less important and only lowers collateral damage to the ship hull.\n\nYour marine losses depend on their combined fighting skill, but in Zero Hour also on how many marines you send. More marines means that more of them tend to get killed. Don't send elite teams of highly skilled marines against low value targets like an M6.\n\nAll you really need is just one decent hacker who reaches the final ship deck and a good mechanic for each boarding pod that you fire. Each pod holds 5 marines.\nAll ships can carry 15 marines. TPs store 60 marines.\nA Transporter Device allows to remotely exchange marines between ships and select your boarding team.\nOnly TM, M6, M7, M8, M1 and M2 can be boarded.\nYou can fire additional boarding pods during the operation. For example to send a marine with good hacking skill later during the fight and increase his chance of survival.[/justify]</t>
<t id="29">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou just suffered random marine losses on the final ship bridge. For each boarding operation there is an enemy kamikaze ambush or boobytrap explosion at the very end, which can kill additional marines. The difference to the previous deck fights is that your fighting skill does not help to prevent marine losses. It only matters how many marines have reached the final ship bridge. The more crowded it is in the end, the more losses you will suffer. These losses get selected randomly across your entire team and this can easily kill marines who actually got a high fighting skill.\n\nThis means that there is an incentive for you to only send just enough skilled marines so that you can pass all those skill checks and win the ship. You do not want to send too many mechanical or hacking specialists so that you do not loose them during the final random casualty round. You can try to board with fewer but better skilled marines to reduce overall random losses, or send them with some rookie volunteers who can be hired en masse as a meatshield. Rookies add a little bit of fighting skill to your side, but its no real loss if they die. What matters most is to keep your veteran fighters and mechanical or hacking specialists alive. And this is intentionally more difficult in this mod.[/justify]</t>
<t id="30">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WPirate Gang Leaders usually have the highest bounties. If you kill these leaders the gang morale will break completely and they scatter into different directions.\nHunting gang leaders is a good way to make lots of money during the earlier stages of your playthrough. Especially since you don't need to defeat the entire group and can make them flee in panic.\n\nOther frequent bounties are Pirate Raid Carrier TMs. Those transport pirate fighters over larger distances and drop them near helpless victims. The bounty on these TMs increases for each such fighter hot drop they perform. But the TM is very fast, decently shielded and always wants to escape, so it might prove difficult to catch.\nIf a TM reaches a very large bounty it can return to a pirate base to get a hull respray. This is like removing wanted level in GTA and clears the bounty.[/justify]</t>
<t id="31">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYour Jump Beacon attracts small Xenon scouts which try to turn it against you. They want to create a teleport route for larger Xenon fleets.\n\nIts highly recommended that you guard each jump beacon with at least 1 M3 fighter. Its usually enough to park a ship nearby in space without giving any specific orders. It automatically attacks any approaching Xenon scout and you will get notified at the bottom of your screen. You can also tell that ship to Escort:Protect the jump beacon itself so it always returns back to it.\n\nWhen you own more jump beacons the frequency at which Xenon scouts try to infect one of them increases. But having lots of beacons is usually well worth it as long as they help your travel network in any way and you protect them. Strategically important beacons should eventually be guarded by stronger forces like small fighter wings or an M6. You don't want a large Xenon invasion suddenly pour into the heart of your empire![/justify]</t>
<t id="32">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]\033WYou already played for a while, but i don't see any larger ships like frigates in your fleet.\nThats no problem, but did you know that pirate bases often contain an M7 boss that you can fight to win his ship? But you need to scare him fast enough by draining his shields. Then he will bail out and you can claim the ship. If you take too long with the shields he will become too confident and not bail.\n\nAnoher fast way to unlock larger ships is to steal one with marines or the Oxygen virus hack and then reverse engineering it in an Outpost recycling bay. This completes a large portion of the ship blueprint and you can quickly research the rest.[/justify]</t>
<t id="33">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author][white]Lots of pirates are flying around in your sector[/white] %s [white]. They are probably coming from some Pirate Base in the general area.\nThe Pirates are much less aggressive than the Xenon and often wait for easy targets like TS and TP. Those freighters usually manage to flee to a station well before their shields get breached, but heavy pirate activity prevents them from doing their work and it makes long trips very risky.\n\nTips:\n\n> thin out the pirate horde by setting up an automatic fast and survivable picket fleet of at least 3 fighters. This is a very cost effective investment into your sector's security. Try the following fleet settings:\nMonitor all sectors of this faction: PLAYER\nRetreat from enemy ship class: M6\nScanning range: 0 KM\nFollowers engage commanders target: YES\nIgnore: BIG SHIPS and FREIGHTERS\n\n> consider to keep your current freighters docked and not use them as Agents, Miners or Traders yet. Instead form them up into a large convoy for better safety and buy or sell manually with this entire group. Keep them together and protect them with all your military ships if need be.\n\n> use TM or M6 as Looters instead of TS or TP. The pirates rarely ever attack anything other than freighter class ships\n\n> gain some infamy. All pirates will attack you much less if you have a criminal history just like them.\n\n> open your stations to NPC Traders so that you don't need to send your own freighters. Stations which need a resource input should be given some money to be able to buy from Traders. Its never a good idea to keep stations idle when they could be working. Each factory is basically a refinement process that consumes something less valuable to make something more valuable. This includes your Outposts which consume food but also produce twice as much other food together with additional resources like Waste for free.\n\n> unlock the Pirate Contract perk if you are completely surrounded or desperate\n\n> once you have a fleet of about 3 M6 and a dozen M3 fighters you can destroy that pirate base near your empire. This often helps substantially to reduce pirate density for an extended period of time.[/white][/justify]</t>

All factions generally desire to own their dejure sectors and don't like it when other factions control them. Its often a focus of their Battlegroups.\n\nYou are playing on a difficulty level which eventually allows the AI to declare war on you.

Other factions also sometimes build terran ships when they own these sectors.\n\nThe Terrans themselves don't like that their shiny tech is getting bastardized like that. They generally want all memory sectors for themselves. So their Battlegroups will often focus on these sectors first.\n\nYou are playing on a difficulty level which allows the AI to declare war on you. By controlling %s you already give the Terrans a major incentive to declare war on you. If you want to remain friendly to them it might be best to hand the sector over to them. This can be done from the personal console in sector management.[/justify]</t>
<t id="36">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You have just built your first factory, a %s.\n\nIt needs to get served by a freighter from time to time so that it can keep producing. Most factories need resource deliveries and finished products need to get hauled away. Mayhem 3 doesn't have any self sufficient complexes, so cargo transport via ship is always a thing. There are many different solutions!\n\nIn general you got three different ways how to organize all the shipping logistics in your empire. There is no universal best method and all of them have their uses.\n\n1\) Manual Shipping\nDon't underestimate how long just a single visit by a freighter can keep a factory supplied and running. This is due to the massively increased cargo space in Mayhem 3 compared to other mods.\nDuring the earlygame many players struggle with pirates who attack their freighters. The easiest fix for this is to send a freighter with a manual command and deliver the resources only when its quite safe. For example after a dangerous pirate group has just left your sector. Don't be ashamed if you have to group up all your ships and fly from station to station if need be. This is fine and will get better.\n\n2\) Automatic Closed Economy\nEventually you want a network of Agent Workers who distribute most resources between your stations. Their homebase can be a factory, but homebasing them to Outposts is recommended as this requires fewer ships.\nIn Logistics>Agents you can tell each Outpost which wares its own Agents should gather or redustribute from there.\nIts best to apply the 'Complete' template to fill the job list. This covers all relevant factories and you can make further changes or create more job templates if needed. The Outpost Worker range determines how far your Agents are allowed to go on the galaxy map. If a sector is too dangerous you can blacklist it for the time being.\n\n3\) Free Trade\nEach station will either allow foreign traders to come and trade, or it forbids them from doing so. On player owned stations its blocked by default but you can always turn it on.\nThis can be very useful, especially during the earlygame. Sometimes your freighters are unable to reach their destinations because of frequent pirate attacks. Then why not let other factions do the hauling for you? The refinement process in your factories earns enough profit to do this. You can keep all your freighters safe and docked, but your factories will still produce and generate value. This leads to faster economic growth. Later you can switch over to a closed economy and forbid trade again.\n\nMost factories will need about 100k credits starting capital to buy their first resources. Its almost impossible to loose money here as long as you keep selling what you produce and don't stockpile too much.\n\nYour Outpost will only trade wares that you have added to a special trade list in Logistics>Traders\n\nThe downside of allowing trade is that you cannot prevent a Trader from bringing your resources to another faction. That's why you should always forbid trade on a few strategically important ship part factories like Hull Plating or Crystal fabs, unless you just want to make money at this point.[/justify]</t>
<t id="37">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]Claiming %s drained most of your %s reputation. This is no immediate problem, but to be able to expand a lot more towards their borders and still remain friendly you should earn more goodwill first.\n\nAs an instant reputation gain you can do missions or cargo hauler or taxi jobs.\n\nA very useful passive way to grind reputation by hunting pirates in %s sectors with automated fleets. Try these settings:\n\n\nAnti-Fighter:\nrequires at least 3 M3, better 5 > Monitor faction: %s, Retreat from ship class: M6, Scanning range: 0 KM, Followers attack commanders target: YES, Ignore: BIG SHIPS and FREIGHTERS\n\nAnti-Corvette:\nsomething like 1 M7 or 3 M6 with fleet settings > Monitor faction: %s, Retreat from ship class: LARGE CAPSHIPS, Scanning range: 10 KM, Followers attack commanders target: NO, Target priority for huge ships: BIG SHIPS, Ignore: FIGHTERS and FREIGHTERS[/justify]</t>
<t id="38">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]You don't have many %s left.\n\nThis is one of the 4 critical components that are required to produce ships or their shields and lasers.\n\nYou should always try to refill Computers, Hull Plating, Quantum Tubes and the basic non colored Crystals as soon as you start to run out. It is often required to buy more of them before you have built all the required factories to get your own supply.\n\n%s might be difficult to find on the open market. This is because Terracorp forbids all trading stations to deal with high-end ship parts.\n\nBut you can always buy them directly from %s factories and sometimes certain faction Outposts with very large stockpiles will sell them too. But this depens on which factories are around them.\n\nIf you tell a freighter the command Trade-Run:Buy %s he might find such a high quantity seller. But oftentimes everybody will be short since you are not the only one who needs to build ships.\nTrade Run is an automated trade command. Your guy gives the station a call so that they already reserve the wares for him. Trader Workers do the same.\n\nWhen you cannot find a seller it doesn't mean that this good doesn't exist, it just means that nobody wants to sell. Small amounts are always available but they cannot be bought using automated trade methods.\nFactories are willing to sell if you show up personally or tell a freighter to dock and then do the trade manually. To find these hidden sellers you should use the Trade Product Search command. You often got to pay a higher price but thats still better than not getting this ware at all.\n\nWhen everything fails you can craft %s with the mobile factory in your TL. But this consumes way more resources than normal factories, so better try to get those asap.[/justify]</t>
<t id="39">[justify][author]\033YTutorial[/author]The %s want to create a coalition against the %s. You can see this in the relations tab of your Ministry of War \(Personal Console\).\n\nA coalition is when multiple smaller factions try to reduce the territory size of a larger empire.\n\nYou can also join or get targeted by a coalition. In the diplomacy screen you can declare that you want a coalition against another empire.\nThis alliance gets created when two factions both want a coalition against the same enemy. More factions can join in later.\n\nExample: If you would declare your desire to join a coalition against the %s right now, then this would create a coalition together with the %s.\n\nCoalitions have certain benefits:\n\n> your coalition partners will never declare war on you \(this is only relevant when playing on hardest game difficulty\)\n> you can activate free diplomatic favor actions\n> your partners won't mind if you conquer sectors at their borders\n\nYou can revoke your own coalition desire as long as you have not become a member yet. Coalition members always have to fight to the end. The Coalition only gets dissolved once the targeted enemy faction eventually owns less sectors than the largest coalition member.[/justify]</t>
